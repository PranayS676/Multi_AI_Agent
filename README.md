# Agentic AI Project

## 📚 **What are Agents?**
Agents are AI systems designed to autonomously make decisions, perform tasks, and interact with tools and databases. Unlike traditional workflows, which follow predefined sequences, agents dynamically adapt their behavior based on the task requirements. They are particularly useful in complex and flexible environments where decision-making cannot be entirely scripted.

### 🛠️ **Workflows vs. Agents**
- **Workflows:** Predictable and consistent for well-defined tasks.
- **Agents:** Dynamic, model-driven decision-making suitable for scalable and flexible tasks.

### 🚀 **Real-World Applications of Agents**
- **Customer Support:** Intelligent chatbots that resolve complex queries.
- **Financial Analysis:** Systems that evaluate stock performance and provide portfolio recommendations.
- **Content Generation:** Agents that generate, summarize, and validate articles.

## 🤖 **What is an Augmented LLM?**
An **Augmented LLM (Large Language Model)** enhances the capabilities of a standard LLM by integrating:
1. **Retrieval:** Fetching relevant information in real-time.
2. **Tools:** Accessing APIs, performing calculations, and interacting with other systems.
3. **Memory:** Retaining past interactions for context-aware responses.

This augmentation empowers agents to operate with tailored capabilities and deliver high-performance results across diverse tasks.

## 📝 **About This Project**
This project demonstrates how Agentic AI can be applied in real-world scenarios.

### **Agent 1: Summarization & Validation**
- **Functionality:** Summarizes content and validates it against trusted sources.
- **Database Integration:** While the current implementation does not directly connect to a database, it can validate summaries via database queries in production environments.
- **Business Impact:** Ensures content accuracy and builds trust with stakeholders.

### **Agent 2: Article Generation**
- **Functionality:** Generates detailed articles based on stakeholder prompts.
- **Summarization & Validation:** Summarizes the generated article and validates source information.
- **Business Impact:** Provides accurate, on-demand content generation with built-in validation for transparency.

## 📊 **How It Benefits Companies**
- Streamlined content generation and validation processes.
- Real-time insights and analysis via dynamic database integration.
- Improved decision-making through accurate and validated data.
