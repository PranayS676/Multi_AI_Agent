2024-12-03T12:36:23.741501-0500 DEBUG   user: Please provide a concise summary of the following medical text:

hysicians meet with dozens of patients every day and make critical health-related recommendations based on notes, patient descriptions, test results, and diagnostic information gathered in those meetings. All this textual information is typically amassed in the patient’s electronic health record (EHR). The sheer volume of information in electronic health records has become an inflection point in modern medicine. Most doctors now rely on short summaries of long-form notes and medical records to manage patient care.

“The clinical burden of medical documentation is high, and it is time-consuming work. And this has consequences for patients,” says Dave Van Veen, a doctoral candidate in electrical engineering and first author of a new study in the journal Nature Medicine, who is exploring the possibilities of AI-assisted summarization. “Doctors have less time for patient care and there is always the possibility of error anytime you are summarizing information from EHR.”

In the study, Van Veen and colleagues at Stanford University have adapted eight large language models (LLMs) to clinical text and tested their summarization skills against those of human medical experts. More often than not, the researchers say, physicians preferred summaries generated by AI to those done by humans. 

Read the study, Adapted Large Language Models can Outperform Medical Experts in Clinical Text Summarization

 

“AI often generates summaries that are comparable to or better than those written by medical experts. This demonstrates the potential of LLMs to integrate into the clinical workflow and reduce documentation burden,” says the study’s senior author, Akshay Chaudhari, an assistant professor of radiology and, by courtesy, of biomedical data science. “Such technology development and validation may allow clinicians to spend more time with patients rather than the EHR.” 

Apples to Apples
Summarizing medical records is difficult, highly consequential, and detail-oriented work even for experienced medical professionals. 

“We think AI has great potential to serve in an assistive capacity to expedite the physician’s caseload and also to reduce errors. More time with the patient and greater accuracy could lead to better patient care,” says Van Veen.

In their study, Chaudhari, Van Veen, and colleagues worked with eight established LLMs and adapted them to summarize a range of textual medical information—radiology reports, patient questions, progress notes, and doctor–patient dialogues. Then, in blind tests, a panel of 10 physicians compared summaries generated by the best performing LLMs to those created by human medical experts, rating the summaries on “completeness, correctness, and conciseness.” 

“In most cases, summaries from the best-adapted LLMs were rated as good or better than those created by humans,” Van Veen says. Almost half the time (45%), evaluators thought the AI-generated summaries were at least as good as the human-produced ones. More than a third of the time (36%), they judged them “superior.”

No Room for Error
Knowing that much has been made of AI’s tendency to “hallucinate”—to, in essence, make up information that is not true—the researchers were keen to explore whether AI would introduce fabricated information into their summaries. If so, it would be a huge strike against AI, considering the serious consequences of the medical setting.

“It turns out that humans also get things wrong sometimes and that the best model, while not perfect, produced fewer instances of fabricated information than even human medical experts,” Van Veen says. “Far from introducing inaccuracies, LLMs could actually end up reducing fabricated information in clinical practice.”

Van Veen and colleagues will now fine-tune their models and eventually work to bring AI-assistance to real-world clinical settings.

“Stay tuned. We’re close to testing LLMs in real-world environments and helping doctors spend less time on documentation so they can provide better care to patients,” Van Veen says.

This demonstrates the potential of LLMs to integrate into the clinical workflow and reduce documentation burden,” says the study’s senior author, Akshay Chaudhari, an assistant professor of radiology and, by courtesy, of biomedical data science. “Such technology development and validation may allow clinicians to spend more time with patients rather than the EHR.” 

Apples to Apples
Summarizing medical records is difficult, highly consequential, and detail-oriented work even for experienced medical professionals. 

“We think AI has great potential to serve in an assistive capacity to expedite the physician’s caseload and also to reduce errors. More time with the patient and greater accuracy could lead to better patient care,” says Van Veen.

In their study, Chaudhari, Van Veen, and colleagues worked with eight established LLMs and adapted them to summarize a range of textual medical information—radiology reports, patient questions, progress notes, and doctor–patient dialogues. Then, in blind tests, a panel of 10 physicians compared summaries generated by the best performing LLMs to those created by human medical experts, rating the summaries on “completeness, correctness, and conciseness.” 

“In most cases, summaries from the best-adapted LLMs were rated as good or better than those created by humans,” Van Veen says. Almost half the time (45%), evaluators thought the AI-generated summaries were at least as good as the human-produced ones. More than a third of the time (36%), they judged them “superior.”

No Room for Error
Knowing that much has been made of AI’s tendency to “hallucinate”—to, in essence, make up information that is not true—the researchers were keen to explore whether AI would introduce fabricated information into their summaries. If so, it would be a huge strike against AI, considering the serious consequences of the medical setting.

“It turns out that humans also get things wrong sometimes and that the best model, while not perfect, produced fewer instances of fabricated information than even human medical experts,” Van Veen says. “Far from introducing inaccuracies, LLMs could actually end up reducing fabricated information in clinical practice.”

Van Veen and colleagues will now fine-tune their models and eventually work to bring AI-assistance to real-world clinical settings.

“Stay tuned. We’re close to testing LLMs in real-world environments and helping doctors spend less time on documentation so they can provide better care to patients,” Van Veen says.

hysicians meet with dozens of patients every day and make critical health-related recommendations based on notes, patient descriptions, test results, and diagnostic information gathered in those meetings. All this textual information is typically amassed in the patient’s electronic health record (EHR). The sheer volume of information in electronic health records has become an inflection point in modern medicine. Most doctors now rely on short summaries of long-form notes and medical records to manage patient care.

“The clinical burden of medical documentation is high, and it is time-consuming work. And this has consequences for patients,” says Dave Van Veen, a doctoral candidate in electrical engineering and first author of a new study in the journal Nature Medicine, who is exploring the possibilities of AI-assisted summarization. “Doctors have less time for patient care and there is always the possibility of error anytime you are summarizing information from EHR.”

In the study, Van Veen and colleagues at Stanford University have adapted eight large language models (LLMs) to clinical text and tested their summarization skills against those of human medical experts. More often than not, the researchers say, physicians preferred summaries generated by AI to those done by humans.

2024-12-03T12:37:07.241870-0500 DEBUG   system: You are an AI assistant that summarizes medical texts.
2024-12-03T12:37:07.242013-0500 DEBUG   user: Please provide a concise summary of the following medical text:

hysicians meet with dozens of patients every day and make critical health-related recommendations based on notes, patient descriptions, test results, and diagnostic information gathered in those meetings. All this textual information is typically amassed in the patient’s electronic health record (EHR). The sheer volume of information in electronic health records has become an inflection point in modern medicine. Most doctors now rely on short summaries of long-form notes and medical records to manage patient care.

“The clinical burden of medical documentation is high, and it is time-consuming work. And this has consequences for patients,” says Dave Van Veen, a doctoral candidate in electrical engineering and first author of a new study in the journal Nature Medicine, who is exploring the possibilities of AI-assisted summarization. “Doctors have less time for patient care and there is always the possibility of error anytime you are summarizing information from EHR.”

In the study, Van Veen and colleagues at Stanford University have adapted eight large language models (LLMs) to clinical text and tested their summarization skills against those of human medical experts. More often than not, the researchers say, physicians preferred summaries generated by AI to those done by humans.

“AI often generates summaries that are comparable to or better than those written by medical experts. This demonstrates the potential of LLMs to integrate into the clinical workflow and reduce documentation burden,” says the study’s senior author, Akshay Chaudhari, an assistant professor of radiology and, by courtesy, of biomedical data science. “Such technology development and validation may allow clinicians to spend more time with patients rather than the EHR.” 

Apples to Apples
Summarizing medical records is difficult, highly consequential, and detail-oriented work even for experienced medical professionals. 

“We think AI has great potential to serve in an assistive capacity to expedite the physician’s caseload and also to reduce errors. More time with the patient and greater accuracy could lead to better patient care,” says Van Veen.

In their study, Chaudhari, Van Veen, and colleagues worked with eight established LLMs and adapted them to summarize a range of textual medical information—radiology reports, patient questions, progress notes, and doctor–patient dialogues. Then, in blind tests, a panel of 10 physicians compared summaries generated by the best performing LLMs to those created by human medical experts, rating the summaries on “completeness, correctness, and conciseness.” 

“In most cases, summaries from the best-adapted LLMs were rated as good or better than those created by humans,” Van Veen says. Almost half the time (45%), evaluators thought the AI-generated summaries were at least as good as the human-produced ones. More than a third of the time (36%), they judged them “superior.”

No Room for Error
Knowing that much has been made of AI’s tendency to “hallucinate”—to, in essence, make up information that is not true—the researchers were keen to explore whether AI would introduce fabricated information into their summaries. If so, it would be a huge strike against AI, considering the serious consequences of the medical setting.

“It turns out that humans also get things wrong sometimes and that the best model, while not perfect, produced fewer instances of fabricated information than even human medical experts,” Van Veen says. “Far from introducing inaccuracies, LLMs could actually end up reducing fabricated information in clinical practice.”

Van Veen and colleagues will now fine-tune their models and eventually work to bring AI-assistance to real-world clinical settings.

“Stay tuned. We’re close to testing LLMs in real-world environments and helping doctors spend less time on documentation so they can provide better care to patients,” Van Veen says.

2024-12-03T18:39:16.261763-0500 INFO [WriteArticleTool] Received response: ChatCompletionMessage(content="Title: The Impact of Artificial Intelligence in Sports: A Focus on Cricket Analytics \n\nAbstract:\n\nThis article explores the evolving role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in sports, with a particular focus on cricket analytics. It investigates how AI is transforming the way sports are played, coached, and viewed, and how it is being utilized to analyze and predict performance in cricket. The paper further discusses the potential benefits, challenges, and implications of AI in cricket analytics.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has been a game-changer across various industries, with sports being no exception. The integration of AI in sports is revolutionizing not just how games are played, but also how they are understood and enjoyed. This paper specifically delves into the realm of cricket, a sport with a rich history and global following, to understand the transformative potential of AI through cricket analytics. \n\nAI in Sports:\n\nAI's influence is rapidly increasing in the sports sector, with its ability to gather, process, and analyze vast amounts of data in real time. AI systems can provide valuable insights into player performance, injury prediction, and game strategy. They can also enhance the viewer experience by providing personalized content, interactive interfaces, and real-time analysis during live games.\n\nAI in Cricket Analytics:\n\nCricket, like many other sports, is a data-rich environment. AI's analytical capabilities can be harnessed to gain insights from this data, leading to better decision-making both on and off the field. For instance, predictive analytics using AI can assist in strategy formulation by simulating different game scenarios based on historical data. It can also help in player selection, identifying player strengths and weaknesses, and predicting player performance.\n\nAI can also significantly enhance the fan experience. Advanced AI algorithms can provide real-time statistics, player performance analysis, and predictive outcomes, adding a new dimension to how fans engage with the sport.\n\nBenefits and Challenges:\n\nThe potential benefits of AI in cricket analytics are considerable. AI can lead to more informed decision-making, improved player performance, reduced risk of injury, and enhanced fan engagement. However, there are also challenges to consider. These include the need for accurate and comprehensive data, the risk of over-reliance on AI, and the potential ethical considerations around data privacy and fairness in decision-making.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAI in cricket analytics presents a promising yet complex landscape.

Fetal Remnants
In addition to the rudimentary valve of the inferior vena
cava, there are the fossa ovalis and the anulus ovalis
(Fig. 1-11). These structures lie on the atrial septum, which
separates the right atrium from the left atrium. The fossa

ovalis is a shallow depression that is the site of the fora-
men ovale in the fetus. (Before birth, oxygenated blood

passed through this foramen from the right atrium into the
left atrium.) The anulus ovalis forms the upper margin of
the fossa.

RIGHT VENTRICLE

The right ventricle forms the greater part of the anterior sur-
face of the heart, and it lies anterior to the left ventricle (Fig.

1-11). The right ventricle communicates with the right

atrium through the atrioventricular orifice and with the pul-
monary trunk through the pulmonary orifice. The approach

to the pulmonary orifice is funnel shaped and known as the
infundibulum.
The walls of the right ventricle are much thicker than

those of the right atrium. The internal surface shows pro-
jecting ridges called trabeculae carneae. There are three

types of these ridges:

• Papillary muscles are attached by their bases to the ven-
tricular wall. Their apices are connected by fibrous chords

(chordae tendineae) to the cusps of the tricuspid valve.
• The ridges are attached at their ends to the ventricular wall
and are free in the middle. The moderate band is a large

ridge, and it is attached at its ends to the septal and the an-
terior ventricular walls. It conveys within it the right

branch of the atrioventricular bundle, which is part of the
conducting system of the heart.
• Simple, prominent projections.
Tricuspid Valve
The tricuspid valve guards the atrioventricular orifice (Fig. 1-

11). It consists of three cusps, the bases of which are at-
tached to the fibrous ring of the skeleton of the heart. To

their free edges and ventricular surfaces are attached the

chordae tendineae, which connect the cusps to the papil-
lary muscles. The cusps are the anterior, septal, and infe-
rior. The anterior cusp lies anteriorly; the septal cusp,

against the ventricular septum; and the inferior cusp,
inferiorly.
Pulmonary Valve
The pulmonary valve guards the pulmonary orifice, and the
three semilunar cusps of this valve are attached by their
curved, lower margins to the arterial wall. The open mouths
of the cusps are directed upward into the pulmonary trunk.
There are one posterior and two anterior semilunar cusps.
The pulmonary sinuses are three dilatations at the root of
the pulmonary trunk, with one being situated external to
each cusp (see the section on the aortic valve).

Original Data:
Fetal Remnants
In addition to the rudimentary valve of the inferior vena
cava, there are the fossa ovalis and the anulus ovalis
(Fig. 1-11). These structures lie on the atrial septum, which
separates the right atrium from the left atrium. The fossa

ovalis is a shallow depression that is the site of the fora-
men ovale in the fetus. (Before birth, oxygenated blood

passed through this foramen from the right atrium into the
left atrium.) The anulus ovalis forms the upper margin of
the fossa.

RIGHT VENTRICLE

The right ventricle forms the greater part of the anterior sur-
face of the heart, and it lies anterior to the left ventricle (Fig.

1-11). The right ventricle communicates with the right

atrium through the atrioventricular orifice and with the pul-
monary trunk through the pulmonary orifice. The approach

to the pulmonary orifice is funnel shaped and known as the
infundibulum.
The walls of the right ventricle are much thicker than

those of the right atrium. The internal surface shows pro-
jecting ridges called trabeculae carneae. There are three

types of these ridges:

• Papillary muscles are attached by their bases to the ven-
tricular wall. Their apices are connected by fibrous chords

(chordae tendineae) to the cusps of the tricuspid valve.
• The ridges are attached at their ends to the ventricular wall
and are free in the middle. The moderate band is a large

ridge, and it is attached at its ends to the septal and the an-
terior ventricular walls. It conveys within it the right

branch of the atrioventricular bundle, which is part of the
conducting system of the heart.
• Simple, prominent projections.
Tricuspid Valve
The tricuspid valve guards the atrioventricular orifice (Fig. 1-

11). It consists of three cusps, the bases of which are at-
tached to the fibrous ring of the skeleton of the heart. To

their free edges and ventricular surfaces are attached the

chordae tendineae, which connect the cusps to the papil-
lary muscles. The cusps are the anterior, septal, and infe-
rior. The anterior cusp lies anteriorly; the septal cusp,

against the ventricular septum; and the inferior cusp,
inferiorly.
Pulmonary Valve
The pulmonary valve guards the pulmonary orifice, and the
three semilunar cusps of this valve are attached by their
curved, lower margins to the arterial wall. The open mouths
of the cusps are directed upward into the pulmonary trunk.
There are one posterior and two anterior semilunar cusps.
The pulmonary sinuses are three dilatations at the root of
the pulmonary trunk, with one being situated external to
each cusp (see the section on the aortic valve).

LEFT ATRIUM
The left atrium (Fig. 1-12) lies posterior to the right atrium. It
consists of a main cavity and an auricle. The interior of the
auricle possesses muscular ridges as in the right auricle.
Openings
The four pulmonary veins, two from each lung, open
through the posterior wall; there are no valves. The left
atrioventricular orifice is guarded by the mitral valve.

LEFT VENTRICLE

The left ventricle is situated largely behind the right ventri-
cle (Fig. 1-12). A small portion, however, projects to the left

and forms the left margin of the heart and the heart apex.
The left ventricle communicates with the left atrium through
the atrioventricular orifice and with the aorta through the
aortic orifice. The walls of the left ventricle are three times

thicker than those of the right ventricle. There are trabecu-
lae carneae and two papillary muscles; however, there is

no moderator band. The aortic vestibule is the part of the
ventricle below the aortic orifice.
